It's a risky game as old as time itself: Strip Poker. One Winner. One Loser. One ring to rule them all. One ring to find them. No clothes, all attitude. This summer, two mighty heroes take on their biggest challenge yet. Who will win? Who will die? Yes.

This channel, along with every video that has or will ever be uploaded on this channel, will be deleted after our year has ended. This is inevitable. Inescapable. Irreversible.

Do not archive or re-upload anything. This is our last wish. Our parting gift. Stay true to the purpose of our final year or we shall lay down wrath upon those that attempt to escape the end.

Memento Mori.

Unus Annus.
