As Shrek once told me in a dark alley on a stormy night, "Onions have layers..." That message has been cemented into my mind among other things Shrek whispered into my ear. But in this video we discover the true versatility of the mythical Onion and if there is such a thing as too much Onion.

This channel, along with every video that has or will ever be uploaded on this channel, will be deleted after our year has ended. This is inevitable. Inescapable. Irreversible.

Do not archive or re-upload anything. This is our last wish. Our parting gift. Stay true to the purpose of our final year or we shall lay down wrath upon those that attempt to escape the end.

Memento Mori.

Unus Annus.
