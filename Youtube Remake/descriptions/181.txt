Two men of extremely adequate height discuss the upper limits of humanity's height potential. Not that it matters. Height is more a curiosity than a social necessity. There's nothing wrong with being not incredibly tall. Height is a spectrum. And we are on the highest point of the bell curve. So if you think about it... we're actually pretty "up there." Which is a synonym for tall. So through the transitive property, one could say that we are tall.

This channel, along with every video that has or will ever be uploaded on this channel, will be deleted after our year has ended. This is inevitable. Inescapable. Irreversible.

Do not archive or re-upload anything. This is our last wish. Our parting gift. Stay true to the purpose of our final year or we shall lay down wrath upon those that attempt to escape the end.

Memento Mori.

Unus Annus.
