Mark wants to be immortalized in a sculpture but marble is too expensive and experts even more so. Thus the only options left are a Tape Sculpture and Ethan... what's the worst that could happen? Surely Ethan wouldn't be foolish enough to tape Mark's mouth over so he can't breathe right? ...right?

This channel, along with every video that has or will ever be uploaded on this channel, will be deleted after our year has ended. This is inevitable. Inescapable. Irreversible.

Do not archive or re-upload anything. This is our last wish. Our parting gift. Stay true to the purpose of our final year or we shall lay down wrath upon those that attempt to escape the end.

Memento Mori.

Unus Annus.
