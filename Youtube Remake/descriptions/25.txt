The Barrel has left us and is with the great mechanic in the sky... but there may still be hope. Through the power of song, we may be able to bring her back. Upload your video using #RIPTheBarrel in the description and we'll pick the winner one week from now. Who knows, maybe... just maybe, we'll be able to make a miracle happen.

This channel, along with every video that has or will ever be uploaded on this channel, will be deleted after our year has ended. This is inevitable. Inescapable. Irreversible.

Do not archive or re-upload anything. This is our last wish. Our parting gift. Stay true to the purpose of our final year or we shall lay down wrath upon those that attempt to escape the end.

Memento Mori.

Unus Annus.
