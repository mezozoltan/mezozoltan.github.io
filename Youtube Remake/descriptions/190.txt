You hear that? Off in the distance? That, my friends, is the sound of two gods screaming into the ether. It is the first sound in the morning and the last sound at night. It is the call to end all calls. It is... THE YODEL.

This channel, along with every video that has or will ever be uploaded on this channel, will be deleted after our year has ended. This is inevitable. Inescapable. Irreversible.

Do not archive or re-upload anything. This is our last wish. Our parting gift. Stay true to the purpose of our final year or we shall lay down wrath upon those that attempt to escape the end.

Memento Mori.

Unus Annus.
