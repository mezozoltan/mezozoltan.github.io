Turns out we made a lot of videos this year, and if you're just joining us now, you may not have the time to watch every one. So, to help you out, we took the time and sanity required to recreate EVERY. SINGLE. VIDEO.

This channel, along with every video that has or will ever be uploaded on this channel, will be deleted after our year has ended. This is inevitable. Inescapable. Irreversible.

Do not archive or re-upload anything. This is our last wish. Our parting gift. Stay true to the purpose of our final year or we shall lay down wrath upon those that attempt to escape the end.

Memento Mori.

Unus Annus.
