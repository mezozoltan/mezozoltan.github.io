We've learned much about ghost hunting throughout this year and now it's time for the final test. We bought the best (cheapest) equipment Amazon could provide and are ready to dive head first into the most haunted house in Los Angeles.

This channel, along with every video that has or will ever be uploaded on this channel, will be deleted after our year has ended. This is inevitable. Inescapable. Irreversible.

Do not archive or re-upload anything. This is our last wish. Our parting gift. Stay true to the purpose of our final year or we shall lay down wrath upon those that attempt to escape the end.

Memento Mori.

Unus Annus.
